Containing Web API files
Bench TestRest
Take-home assignment
Implemented on IIS 6.0
Containing 2 projects:
	1- ASP.NET WebAPI
	2- Console Application
Implemented on local web server.

Description:

When running WebAPI, you can return all data inside JSON file by following 
localhost/api/bench.
You also can return specific Ledgers, Companies, and Amounts by following below URLs:
localhost/api/bench/ledgers,
localhost/api/bench/company,
localhost/api/bench/amount .

As I am uploading the published WebAPI, the console application project file is already
connected to WebAPI and you can run the console application and see the result.

//////Notice: Run the console application while the WebAPI is running or publish the WebAPI to run the console 
application on its own.
